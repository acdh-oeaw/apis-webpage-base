                    The MPR database contains structured entities from the hybrid edition <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/inz/research-units/cultural-heritage/research/minutes-of-the-council-of-ministers-habsburg-monarchy/">'Minutes of the Cisleithanian Council of Ministers, 1867−1918’</a>. The entities mostly refer to persons, places and institutions mentioned in these originally confidential minutes, such as the members of the government, the emperor, members of the higher state administration, citizens who received honors from the emperor, etc. As institutions are concerned, ministries and hundreds of state offices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisleithania">Cisleithania</a> as well as Hungary and abroad were mentioned, but also political parties, representational bodies, and military units. Places mentioned were of course the seats of the aforementioned persons and institutions or the sites where events took place, including historical political entities, such as the kingdoms of the period, and all political and juridical sub-units of Cisleithania. The current web application considers itself as an 'Entity-Hub' of all Entities (Persons, Places, Institutions, Works and Events) mentioned in the Minutes.

                    The Council of Ministers was the central body of government. Its minutes reflect all aspects of political life, from issues concerning the state’s structure and organisation to social, economic and technical developments as well as cultural and social problems. The minutes represent an extraordinary historical source. The edition 'Minutes of the Austrian Council of Ministers’ was launched in 1967 by Friedrich Engel-Janosi in close cooperation with Hungarian historians. It is a full-text and annotated edition of the original documents kept in the <a href="https://www.statearchives.gv.at/">Austrian State Archives</a> (Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv and Allgemeines Verwaltungsarchiv).

                    '<a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/inz/research-units/cultural-heritage/research/minutes-of-the-council-of-ministers-habsburg-monarchy/">Minutes of the Cisleithanian Council of Ministers, 1867−1918</a>’ is the latest of three series that cover the period of the late Habsburg Monarchy from 1848 to 1918. The first edition series has recorded the sessions of the Council of Ministers founded in 1848 (1852−1861 the Conference of Ministers) of the Austrian Empire until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (1. Serie). The Compromise transformed the Austrian Empire into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Three bodies emerged from the until then unified Council of Ministers: the joint Council of Ministers of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy 1867–1918 (edited by the Hungarian academy of Sciences as second edition series, 2. Serie), a Council of Ministers for the Kingdom of Hungary and one for the remaining countries, abbreviated as Austria or Cisleithania. The minutes of the latter's sessions will be edited as the current edition, “The minutes of the Cisleithanian Council of Ministers, 1867−1918” (3. Serie).
